# multifile_PGE
Based of off [olcPGE by javidx9](https://www.github.com/oneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine).  
Instead of olcPGE being a single header with over 5000 lines. i wanted it to be seperated into multiple headers and source files.
## reasons
I got tired of not understanding the engine and it not being seperated into different modules per say, so i'm taking this matter into my own hands to create my own version of olcPGE faithful to the original but seperated into multiple files.
## difficulties
1. Circular dependencies
1. Random syntax errors probably cause by a single syntax error
